## Read in data

Look at the data and come up with the best possible table descriptions. Assess all the ways it could be used
```{r}

```


## Define table using SQL

It's good practice to do this before data collection to establish expectations early on. Things will likely need adjustment as the collection continues, there is SQL ot adjust this. By defining the data structure early on, we are also adding a level of quailty assurance to our data inputs.
```{SQL}
CREATE TABLE Site (
    Code TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    Site_name TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    Location TEXT NOT NULL,
    Latitude REAL NOT NULL CHECK (Latitude BETWEEN -90 AND 90),
    Longitude REAL NOT NULL CHECK (Longitude BETWEEN -180 AND 180),
    "Total_Study_Plot_Area_(ha)" REAL NOT NULL
	CHECK ("Total_Study_Plot_Area_(ha)" > 0),
    UNIQUE (Latitude, Longitude)
);
```

### Directing SQL

This column here is a forward director for the code found in a column of another table.
Foregin key: first references column in table the table it's located in, and then the column it's located in another table
The table at the top is the og table

```{SQL}
CREATE TABLE Camp_assignment (
    …,
    Site TEXT NOT NULL,
    FOREIGN KEY (Site) REFERENCES Site (Code),
    …,
);
```
